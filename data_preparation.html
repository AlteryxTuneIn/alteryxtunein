        <h2>Master Data Preparation for Efficient Analytics</h2>
        <p>Data preparation is a crucial step in the analytics process. In this module, we will guide you through the most powerful techniques in Alteryx to clean, transform, and blend data, ensuring that you're ready to perform analysis on high-quality, well-structured data.</p>
        
        <section>
            <h3>What is Data Preparation?</h3>
            <p>Data preparation involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. It includes tasks like removing duplicates, filling in missing values, normalizing data formats, and combining datasets to make them ready for modeling, reporting, or visualization.</p>

            <h3>Key Data Preparation Tasks in Alteryx</h3>
            <p>In Alteryx, data preparation includes a range of tasks that simplify and automate complex data operations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Cleansing:</strong> Remove or fix invalid, incomplete, or incorrect data. Alteryx offers built-in tools like the "Data Cleansing" tool to automatically clean up data.</li>
                <li><strong>Joining Data:</strong> Merge different data sources, such as databases, CSVs, or Excel files, using various join techniques, including inner, left, right, and outer joins.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtering Data:</strong> Filter out irrelevant or unwanted records using the "Filter" tool, enabling more focused analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting Data:</strong> Sort data based on any field for easier readability and analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Handling Missing Data:</strong> Address missing values through techniques like data imputation, replacement, or removal.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Change the structure of the data to match your analysis needs. Use tools like "Transpose," "Summarize," and "Formula" to manipulate and transform data.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Blending:</strong> Combine data from multiple sources into a single dataset for comprehensive analysis, even if the data comes in different formats or structures.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
